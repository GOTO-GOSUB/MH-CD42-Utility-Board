# MH-CD42-Utility-Board
A utility board for MH-CD42 LiPo boost &amp; charge modules

Very much a work in progress, this PCB acts as a utility board for MH-CD42.
It came about because a lot of these modules are cheap for a reason - they don't always work.
Put female headers in instead of soldering the module to the board to allow for rapid testing.

This board includes a voltage divider to provide a Raspberry Pi safe output voltage to trigger a GPI event (eg a low power shut-down).

Please do not consider this complete, I am still making changes to facilitate easy assembly and availabilty of parts.
